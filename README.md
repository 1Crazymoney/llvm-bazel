# LLVM Bazel BUILD files

DISCLAIMER: This is not an officially-supported Google project and is still in
development.

This repo contains standalone Bazel BUILD configuration for the LLVM Core
sub-project of the [LLVM project](http://llvm.org/) that could be shared by
dependent projects using the Bazel build system.

It is branched off of the
[BUILD file](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/third_party/llvm/llvm.autogenerated.BUILD)
in the [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) project, but aims to be suitable for
more general usage.
